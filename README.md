# webpack x Battleship

05-11-2024: Project is slightly halted due to work, but I
think it's documented enough to make ease of picking it back
up again extremely easy.

I could swear with my current passion I could do this in a
week, hopefully work won't kill that passion.

01-12-2024: I have some time off now after a long period of work. I am absolutely cross with
my problem solving technique, it's responsive - i.e:
1 - I find a problem
2 - I solve it
While it makes sense, it is a very inefficient technique that allowed multiple bugs
to sneak through into later versions. Reactive problem solving does not work,
ditto: tests prevent that - however, I still found myself being reactive rather than
proactive.

Additionally, the layers of complexity has led me to want to start over with a minimized
version of the battleship, as I wanted to keep things simple and stay true to the whole
point of the passion project: to get better at testing. However, I am excited to
keep going and finding out how the final version of the project will turn out.

Most likely, some features are going to have to be cut - since I would have work for 8 days
working 10-12 hours starting DEC 9. I love programing, but it doesnt pay the bills just
yet :(.

Regardless, this project lives on.. and I hope to breathe in new ideas and life into it.
