# webpack x Battleship

05-11-2024: Project is slightly halted due to work, but I
think it's documented enough to make ease of picking it back
up again extremely easy.

I could swear with my current passion I could do this in a
week, hopefully work won't kill that passion.

01-12-2024: I have some time off now after a long period of work. I am absolutely cross with
my problem solving technique, it's responsive - i.e:
1 - I find a problem
2 - I solve it
While it makes sense, it is a very inefficient technique that allowed multiple bugs
to sneak through into later versions. Reactive problem solving does not work,
ditto: tests prevent that - however, I still found myself being reactive rather than
proactive.

Additionally, the layers of complexity has led me to want to start over with a minimized
version of the battleship, as I wanted to keep things simple and stay true to the whole
point of the passion project: to get better at testing. However, I am excited to
keep going and finding out how the final version of the project will turn out.

Most likely, some features are going to have to be cut - since I would have work for 8 days
working 10-12 hours starting DEC 9. I love programing, but it doesnt pay the bills just
yet :(.

Regardless, this project lives on.. and I hope to breathe in new ideas and life into it.

09-12-2024 00:34 AM: My problem solving came in a clutch and work got postponed by a few days. This project actually turned out to be great - it's a great shame, and it was a huge pain, that my plans for medium and hard bots wasn't implemented.

I have pages worth of algorithms and ideas for it, but doing so at this time isn't feasible - especially considering what lies ahead: React, Props, Typescript, and the whole world of JS.

It's all about coming back to the main intention of the project: testing.

In that area, it's a success. I tasted first blood for Jest, and I kind of liked it.

Continuing on with the algorithms would've sated my thirst for curiousity, but it's an activity for another time. There are far more valuable things that can be done: like building a custom CMS, learning Medusa JS, and getting hands on a real world project.

The Battleship project was fun, tough, had mistakes, and has pushed my boundaries. I loved it, for what it is - a testament to my dedication and passion.

The mistakes I have learned, the frustrations I have faced, will be my strengths on next projects.

I look forward to dive deeper into JS
